# iconic-rating
WordPress plugin for reviewing or rating any post type, with stars or other awesome icons, adding some effects on hover (and tooltips).

You can select in which type of post the review appears, where in a DIV, the number and look of the review stars (or whatever icon from font awesome) as well as its behaviour (some CSS3 transformation actions and a tooltip), etc.
